Key Idea
the binary form of every power of two likes 0b100...0, because pow(2, n) == 1 << n
1 = 0b1
2 = 0b10
4 = 0b100
8 = 0b1000
...
the binary form of every pow(2, n) - 1 likes 0b11..1
1 - 1 = 0 = 0b0        =>  1 & 0 = 0b1    & 0b0    = 0
2 - 1 = 1 = 0b1        =>  2 & 1 = 0b10   & 0b1    = 0
4 - 1 = 3 = 0b11       =>  4 & 3 = 0b100  & 0b11   = 0
8 - 1 = 7 = 0b111      =>  8 & 7 = 0b1000 & 0b111  = 0
...
so we can find pow(2, n) & (pow(2, n) - 1) == 0
for example, num = 4 = 0b100
4 - 1 = 3 = 0b11
4 & 3 = 0b100 & 0b11 = 0
Amazing, right?
But that's not enough! We need to expain that if n is not a power of two then n & n - 1 != 0
If m is not a power of two, then the binary form of m contains more than one 1,
 that is 0b1x..x10..0, x represents 0 or 1 so m - 1 = 0b1x..x10..0 - 1 = 0b1x..x01..1,
 that is the first 1 in m is still in the binary form of m - 1, so that
  m & (m - 1) = 0b1x..x0..0 > 0
for example, m = 6 = 0b110
6 - 1 = 5 = 0b101
6 & 5 = 4 = 0b100 > 0
Did you find it? The bold 1 is still there!!!
More generally, for any number n > 0
n & n - 1 removes the last 1 in the binary form of n
if and only if n is a power of two, there is only one 1 in the binary form of n
